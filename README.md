# DictionaryDev

A simple plugin to quickly make terms for notes, write-ups, anything you like on the go! Simply, when writing a new term, follow the following format:

	!!![insert term here]: [insert definition here]!!!

 And it will create a dictionary and add the term to it, and now, every time you write, it will be an offered term to reference! Have fun!
